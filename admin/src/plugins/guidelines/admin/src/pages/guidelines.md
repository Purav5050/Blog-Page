# Blog Guidelines

Welcome to our blog! We value high-quality content that engages and informs our readers. Before creating your blog post, please read these guidelines carefully to ensure your draft is ready for publishing.

**Note:** Blog will be draft only, when you will create first. Make sure your blog is ready to read before publishing it.

## Index Content

- To generate an automatic index content, use header tags (H1 and H2) for headings. The index will be created based on these headers.

## Font Color

- Please use the default font color for your content. Avoid using any custom font colors. If you notice dark text in your blog, check the font color, and if provided, remove it.

## Code Block

- When inserting code snippets, use code blocks and specify the relevant programming language for a prettier preview.

## Preview Link

- For adding links and previews in the blog, simply paste the link, and it will generate a preview.

## Additional Guidelines

- Start writing a blog from `content manager` ➝ `post` ➝ `create new entry`
- Use indentation to add space at the beginning of paragraphs or code blocks.
- Separate divs or sections using horizontal lines.
- The image will be available on the `media library` section on the left sidebar, if not then you can upload it from the blog itself
- Convert gifs to videos for animations
- For `summary` and `meta_description`, you can add them from story settings or make it your own, which is related to your blog
- `is_resource` field should be false for technical blogs
- Include related articles at the end of your post to encourage readers to explore more content.
